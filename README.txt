About current website:
This is written using Javascript.
I chose to use Grid view as main view for this as you can easily get all information about STAR WARS Characters and other information about them in a single screen.
Also I have provided List view as a option.

Next Steps for this project:
1. I would like to improve UI of List View
2. This website is currently non responsive, I would like to devlop a website which is responsive and compatible with many devices.

What excites me about the opportunity:
As this is a opportunity with Stevens Institute which is very prestigious college and reputed educational institute,
I always wanted to work in education field.
Also this position requires experience in  HTML 5, CSS 3, PHP, MySQL, etc in which I have good hands on experience and want to work in the same in future.
So overall Tech Stack in which I will be working in and reputation of Stevens institute excited me to apply for this position.
